Example
-------

It allows to easilly define a workflow, attach it to a class, and use its transitions::

    class MyWorkflow(xworkflows.Workflow):
        # A list of state names
        states = (
            ('foo', _(u"Foo")),
            ('bar', _(u"Bar")),
            ('baz', _(u"Baz")),
        )
        # A list of transition definitions; items are (name, source states, target).
        transitions = (
            ('foobar', 'foo', 'bar'),
            ('gobaz', ('foo', 'bar'), 'baz'),
            ('bazbar', 'baz', 'bar'),
        )
        initial_state = 'foo'


    class MyObject(xworkflows.WorkflowEnabled):
        state = MyWorkflow()

        @transition()
        def foobar(self):
            return 42

        # It is possible to use another method for a given transition.
        @transition('gobaz')
        def blah(self):
            return 13

    >>> o = MyObject()
    >>> o.state
    State('foo')
    >>> o.state.is_foo
    True

    >>> o.foobar()
    42
    >>> o.state
    State('bar')

    >>> o.blah()
    13
    >>> o.state
    State('baz')

Hooks
-----

Custom functions can be hooked to transactions, in order to run before/after a transition,
when entering a state, when leaving a state, ...::


    class MyObject(xworkflows.WorkflowEnabled):

        state = MyWorkflow()

        @xworkflows.before_transition('foobar')
        def my_hook(self, *args, **kwargs):
            # *args and **kwargs are those passed to MyObject.foobar(...)
            pass

        @xworkflows.on_enter_state('bar')
        def my_other_hook(self, result, *args, **kwargs):
            # Will be called just after any transition entering 'bar'
            # result is the value returned by that transition
            # *args, **kwargs are the arguments/keyword arguments passed to the
            # transition.
            pass
